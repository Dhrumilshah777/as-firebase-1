                HOW OUR JOURNEY STARTED

                  35 years ago, our two founders began their journey as humble helpers in a small photography studio. With nothing but passion in their hearts and a relentless commitment to their craft, they worked tirelessly day and night. In 1999, their dream took shape as they opened their very own studio named as Arihant Studio a symbol of their dedication and belief in themselves.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-loose">
                  Through years of hard work, they built not just a business, but a name that earned love and respect across Surat and within the Jain community. By 2006, just seven years later, their small studio had grown into a thriving space with two full-fledged units.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-loose">
                  But their journey didn't stop there. In 2016, with the same spirit that started it all, they opened a second branch in the Pal areaâ€”this time with four beautifully designed units. What started as a dream has now become a legacy of passion, perseverance, and pride.
